Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer with Azure, Submission for the 2nd Task.
Batuhan Ipekci


This project demonstrates 2 alternative ways of deploying a trained model on Azure Machine Learning Studio. At first, the deployment of an AutoML run has been submitted through the user interface of Azure ML Studio. Later, the same process has been done via Python SDK. Both endpoints of those processes have been checked through an HTTP POST request communicating the sample data through a JSON object. At the end, a well-rounded introduction to all the tools in the Azure ML Studio has been accomplished.

## Architectural Diagram

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
